//! `data-store` is a library for secure, deduplicated, transactional, and verifiable data storage.
//!
//! This crate provides high-level abstractions for data storage over a number of storage backends.
//! Storage backends are easy to implement, and this library builds on top of them to provide the
//! following features:
//! - Content-defined block-level deduplication
//! - Transparent encryption
//! - Transparent compression
//! - Integrity checking of data and metadata
//! - Atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID)
//!
//! This library currently provides two abstractions for data storage:
//! - `ObjectRepository` is an object store which maps keys to binary blobs.
//! - `FileRepository` is a file archive like ZIP or TAR which supports symbolic links, modification
//! times, POSIX permissions, and extended attributes.
//!
//! A repository stores its data in a `DataStore`, which is a small trait that can be implemented to
//! create new storage backends. The following data stores are provided out of the box:
//! - `DirectoryStore` stores data in a directory in the local file system.
//! - `MemoryStore` stores data in memory.
