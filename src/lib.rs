//! `disk-archive` is a file format and library for efficiently storing large chunks of binary data.
//!
//! The `disk-archive` file format works similarly to archive formats like ZIP and TAR, with
//! some key differences. Files in a ZIP archive can't be updated in-place. New data can be written
//! to the archive, but the old data sticks around, taking up space. The only way to reclaim space
//! in a ZIP file is to unpack and repack the entire archive. The file format used by this crate
//! doesn't have this limitation, and it provides other benefits like transparent block-level
//! deduplication.
//!
//! While ZIP and TAR files are meant to be portable, archives created by this crate can be used to
//! create high-performance file formats.
//!
//! This crate provides two abstractions for interacting with with the archive format:
//!
//! - `FileArchive` is a file archive like ZIP or TAR which supports modification times, POSIX file
//! permissions, extended attributes, and symbolic links.
//! - `ObjectArchive` is an object store which represents data as a flat list of objects each
//! consisting of a unique name, data, and metadata.
