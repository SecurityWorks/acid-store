//! `disk-archive` is a library for creating high-performance file formats.
//!
//! Many application file formats are built on ZIP archives or SQLite databases. ZIP archives are
//! difficult to update in-place, requiring the entire archive to be unpacked and repacked, which
//! can be expensive for large archives. SQLite databases aren't well-suited for storing large
//! binary blobs, which can be problematic for applications where this is a requirement.
//!
//! This crate provides a custom file format that is designed for storing large binary blobs. It's
//! meant to be used as an alternative to ZIP archives or SQLite databases for creating
//! high-performance file formats. The archive format supports atomic transactions and in-place
//! updates like SQLite while being more suited for storing large blobs.
//!
//! Archives created with this crate support the following features:
//! - Content-defined block-level deduplication
//! - Transparent compression
//! - Transparent encryption
//! - Integrity checking of data
//! - Atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID)
//!
//! For applications which only need to store small (<100KiB) blobs, a SQLite database may be a
//! better choice. For applications which require an open/transparent format, consider using a ZIP
//! archive.
//!
//! This crate provides two abstractions over the archive format:
//! - `FileArchive` is a file archive like ZIP or TAR which supports modification times, POSIX file
//! permissions, extended attributes, and symbolic links.
//! - `ObjectArchive` is an object store which represents data as a flat mapping of keys to binary
//! blobs instead of a hierarchy of files.
